This is a 
\LaTeX template derived from the \beavtex template found on overleaf 
(https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/oregon-state-university-thesis-and-dissertation/wnvzcdhqshxf) 
and cloned using `git clone https://git.overleaf.com/5973847rnpkdf`

I have made the following changes 

 - modified `beavtex.cls` from v1.1 to include support for verbatim font styles
   in R code
 - stripped the template of its original content to create a pandoc template
 - placed this into a bookdown (https://bookdown.org/) framework
 - added packages latexsym, amsmath amssymb,amsthm, longtable, booktabs,
   setspace, url, hyperref, lmodern, caption, and float

This is still a WIP, but it seems to work for the moment.
