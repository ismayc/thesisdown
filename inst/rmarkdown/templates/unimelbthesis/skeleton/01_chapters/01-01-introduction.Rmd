# Introduction

Welcome to my University of Melbourne _R Markdown_ thesis template. This
template is designed to let you produce a nicely formatted thesis using _R
Markdown_. _R Markdown_ allows you to easily keep track of your analyses in
**R** chunks of code, with the resulting plots and output included in the final
document. The hope is this _R Markdown_ template gets you in the habit of doing
reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but also
will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your results
down the road.

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and you will
reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis. The use of LaTeX in combination
with _Markdown_ can be more consistent than the output of a word processor,
much less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller
than a Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past,
your thesis is likely going to be about twice as large and complex as anything
you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities. After working with
_Markdown_ and **R** together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be
your reporting style of choice going forward.

**Why use it?**

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the
beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with
LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to
creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, _R Markdown_ also allows you to
read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions, and
also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your
project. Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the
commentary of your results. You'll see more on this later.

**Who should use it?**

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex
cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their
document should use _R Markdown_. Of particular use should be anyone in the
sciences, but the user-friendly nature of _Markdown_ and its ability to keep
track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of
contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should make it of great
benefit to nearly anyone writing a thesis project.
